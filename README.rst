netjsongraph.js
===============


This is a fork of the original `netjsongraph.js <https://github.com/netjson/netjsongraph.js>`__ library that  apports minimal modifications in order to showcase different views of the original network graph.

Arguments added
---------------

    * ``radius``: the radius of the node in the SVG output. Defaults to 12.

Example Usage
-------------

Follow the installation from the netjsongraph.js package, then point your browser to examples/index.html that shows a snapshot of the ninux topology (note that if you test this in localhost, you need to enable file redirection on chrome, using the --allow-file-access-from-files command line switch). If you point to the examples/condensed-ninux.html page you see a different graph, which is the `block-cut tree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component>`__ representation of the graph. The graph is generated by a different JSON file, the python code to generate it is going to be published soon, this repo just contains minimal modification to the netjsongraph library the and HTML examples to show the results.

Another example can be found in examples/AWMN.html and examples/condensed-AWMN.html.
